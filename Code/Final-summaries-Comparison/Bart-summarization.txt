 Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams to find himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. Franz Kafka was a travelling salesman. He was a man who cut out a picture of a woman wearing a fur hat and fur boa from an illustrated magazine. Kafka’s work is published by Franz Kafka at the University of
 Gregor turned to look out the window at the dull weather, which made him feel sad. “Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business
 He felt a slight itch on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and tried to feel the place with one of his
 He looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. “God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. He could see from the time clock had been set for four o�
 The next train went at seven and the collection of samples was still not packed. Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would have been there to see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s illness. But that would be extremely strained and suspicious.
 Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had heard before. Gregor did in fact, however, feel completely well and even felt hungrier than usual. He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the
 Gregor had a cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home. The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware
 It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow them up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,
 Gregor tried to get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower
 He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. But he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this situation.
 At times like this, he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was engulfed in morning fog. He said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And
 Gregor's back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.
 There was a ring at the door of the flat and he froze very still. “That’ll be someone from work”, he said to himself. But then of course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear the visitor's first words
 Gregor swang himself with all his force out of the bed, but it wasn't really a loud noise. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too. He had not held his head carefully enough, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in
 The chief clerk's footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, his sister whispered to him to let him know: "Gregor, the chief," the chief, is here. He wants to know why you didn’t leave on the early train. We don
 It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw.
 Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family yet. In the room on his left, his sister began to cry; in the other room his sister did not go and join the others. Gregor had not even begun to get dressed; she had probably only gotten up and had only begun to dress.
 The chief clerk raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him, ‘what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail to carry out your business duties in
 "Gregor” called Gregor, a man called Samamsa, was in the middle of the night and was unable to get out of bed. He said: “I’m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. It’s shocking
 Gregor had a small symptom of it last night, perhaps better than me, but his parents must have noticed it already. He said: "Don't make my parents suffer! There’s no basis for any of the accusations you’re making" Gregor said: 'I’ll set off with the eight
 Gregor really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again. Gregor finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave
 “Oh, God!” – his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Quick, get the doctor.”
 The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements. Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering
 Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. He let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself right against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He bit on the key with all his
 Gregor had to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud ‘
 Gregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed, looked at his father and his father looked hostile. Gregor looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook. Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the
 For his father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and Gregor’s father would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of newspapers. On the wall opposite there was a photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on
 It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. Please don’t make things any harder for me than they are already, and don
 The chief clerk turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that
 Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. Gregor's parents did not understand that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present
 Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Gregor held the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor. He held it back and tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who was holding on to
 His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up and her arms outstretched shouting: “Help, for the sake’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way
 Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt several steps at once and disappeared. Gregor’s father had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after Gregor as he did, his father ran after him. Greg
 Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn
 It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him. Gregor was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it.
 Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it. The little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground.
 Gregor was woken by the sound of the door leading into the front room being shut shut. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. The smell of something to eat was what drew him over to the door.
 By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and
 Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to his sister and his parents. Gregor felt great pride that he was able to provide a life like that
 The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides. The gaslight in the living room was finally
 Gregor spent the whole night under the couch under his sister's couch. Gregor often woke from it in alarm because of his hunger. He spent most of the time in a light-deprived sleep, although he often woke in alarm. He decided to remain calm and show patience so that his family could bear the unpleasantness he
 Gregor pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger? If she didn't do it, he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it. Gregor was extremely curious
 There were old, half-rotten vegetables, bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt.
 ‘Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper. The fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at all,
 Gregor watched as his sister swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at once. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out. This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning and twice in
 It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms. He would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body
 There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they had to do now. The maid begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without telling anyone about what had happened.
 Gregor's father had explained to Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, only to receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or ‘no thanks’ Gregor heard
 Gregor thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway. Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family.
 Gregor's sister was a gifted violinist and he wanted to send her to the conservatory next year. Gregor and his family took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was not much warm affection given in return. Their parents did not like to hear this talk, but Gregor decided he would
 There was still some money available from the old days, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. Gregor's mother did not understand everything the first time. He learned that they were not using up all the money that Gregor had brought home every month.
 Gregor could have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s debt to his boss, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things. This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years
 Gregor would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. He would often go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and leaning on the chair to stare out of it. He had used to feel a great sense of freedom
 His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she
 Gregor hid himself under the couch under his sister’s couch for a month after his transformation. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and making noise making; he would stay shivering the whole while, shivering. Gregor would stay silent, but it was impossible for her to be in the same
 Gregor spent four hours carrying the bedsheet to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent it down. Gregor’s parents could not bring themselves into the room to see Gregor in order to thank his sister for her work
 Father and sister would often wait outside the door of Gregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. Greg
 Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about. He got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and the ceiling. Gregor was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor
 Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad
 The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place. Gregor’s sister always took on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignored her mother’�s warnings that she would hurt herself.
 Gregor realised that the lack of direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led him confused during these two months, must have made him confused. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice new furniture he had inherited? Gregor could think of no other way of
 Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition. His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to being Gregor's spokesman to his parents. She had noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture
 Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can. Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself. So she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already
 Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all things made him feel as if he were being ass
 He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor. So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should
 Gregor sat unyielding on his picture on the wall. He would rather jump at his sister's face than her mother’s. But Grete remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look at him. Her mother was quite worried, she stepped to one side of the wall and saw the enormous
 Gregor wanted to help too, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull his own off by force. Grete ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring his mother out of her faint. Gregor stood behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she
 The maid had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer the door. His father arrived home and asked: "What’s happened?” Grete answered him with subdued voice, and pressed her face into his chest: “Mother's fainted, but she's better now.�
 Gregor fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay. His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that. Gregor drew his head back from the door and
 The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when he came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in his nightgown in his armchair. Gregor would often raise his arms but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arm. He was standing up straight
 Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him. Gregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his
 Gregor's father had to constantly carry out countless movements as he ran about. Gregor became noticeably short of breath as he struggled to keep his eyes open. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another.
 The last thing Gregor saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister screaming, his mother screaming and his mother begging his father to spare his life. Gregor wanted to drag himself away, but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread his own out, all his senses in confusion.
 No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility, but this deterioration was made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. He got into the
 Gregor’s father would go to sleep in his chair after dinner, his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet. Gregor's father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg. His sister learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be
 Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep. Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t
 Gregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his face, but nothing would have any effect on him. The household's budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came to do the heaviest
 Gregor learned, listening to the evening dinner, that several items of his family's jewellery had been sold, even though both his mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of
 Gregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. His mother and sister would sit close together in the next room and their tears mingle. Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. After they had returned from taking his father to bed Gregor's father, they would leave their work
 Sometimes he would think of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened. He had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts. Instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they
 Gregor’s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would push some of his food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work and sweep it away again with the broom. Gregor could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as
 Gregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several buckets of water to do it. But that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. Gregor's sister ran back into the living room and broke into convulsive tears. Her father
 Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after him as she had done before was even more work for her. Gregor was taken totally by surprise when she opened the door to his room and found herself face-to-face with him. From then on she never failed to open the door slightly
 Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating, only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, then spit it out again. Gregor was so resentful that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but
 At first he thought distress at the state of his room stopped him eating, but he soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the way of putting things into this room that they had no room for, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms had been rented out to three gentlemen.
 The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she could not use for the time being she would just chuck in there. Gregor would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way into the room too. The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take
 Gregor's mother appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and potatoes piled high with potatoes. The gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother. Gregor’s father and
 Gregor’s mother and his sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again. The family themselves ate in the kitchen. It seemed remarkable to see that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order
 The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway
 His parents, who had never rented a room out before and showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs. His father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the men
 The family was totally preoccupied with the highly-preoccupied violin playing. The three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played. They withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half-the-volume.
 Gregor’s sister was playing beautifully, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if he could. Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he
 Gregor's father tried to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her and kiss her neck
 They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back to their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor's sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow
 He urged them and fiercely pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot firmly. Gregor’s father said: “I give immediate notice on the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”
 Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen
 Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked at Gregor as he lay there immobile.
 Gregor’s sister broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother. “If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as it is...” said his sister,
 If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would've gone of his own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect.
 The pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to
 Gregor was amazed at the distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.
 Gregor could no longer move at once, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He remained in this state of peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly
 When the cleaner came in early in the morning, she thought Gregor Samsa was playing the martyr. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with the broom. She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled and whistled to herself, but
 Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over Gregor's shoulders, and the cleaner gave him a shove with the broom. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just look how thin he was. He was thin.” The cleaner gave the body another shove, sending it sideways across the
 Gregor’s body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now it was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away. “Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa
 The three men stood around Gregor's corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. The three gentlemen held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour. Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his
 Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing of the building. The men bowed without a word and left the premises without any reason to mistrust the men’s intentions. The three men made slow but steady progress down the many steps down the steps. The two women were startled when they saw the three men
 Mr. Samsa and the women decided to go for a walk and write three letters of excusal. The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for that morning. The Samsa family lost interest in the Samsa siblings as they walked down the stairs.
 The cleaner had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa and Grete Samsa for years. The cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to. She suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and called out “Cheerio then,
 Mr. Samsa and his daughter kissed each other and hugged each other before they left the flat together to go to the country outside the town. They discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and
 The couple were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. They agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her. Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.
